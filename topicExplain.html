<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> 

Researchers continue to propose metrics using measurable aspects of a software system to understand code quality. However, these metrics largely ignore the functionality, i.e., the <i>conceptual concerns</i>, of a software system. Such concerns are the main technical concepts that reflect the business logic of the system. For instance, while lines of code may be a good general measure for defects, a large file responsible for simple I/O tasks is likely to have fewer defects than a small file responsible for complicated compiler implementation details.
In this paper, we study the effect of concerns on code quality. We use a statistical topic modeling approach to approximate software concerns as <i> topics</i>. We propose various metrics on these topics to help explain the file defect-proneness (i.e., quality). Case studies on multiple versions of Firefox, Eclipse, Mylyn, and NetBeans show that (i) some topics are more defect-prone than others; (ii) defect-prone topics tend to remain so over time; (iii) our topic-based metrics provide additional explanatory power for code quality over existing structural and historical metrics; and (iv) our topic-based cohesion metric outperforms state-of-the-art topic-based cohesion and coupling metrics in terms of defect explanatory power, while being simpler to implement and more intuitive to interpret.

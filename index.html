I received my PhD in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.queensu.ca">Queen's University</a> in September 2016. I was a member of the <a href="http://sail.cs.queensu.ca/">Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL)</a> and I was supervised by an amazing supervisor <a href="http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~ahmed/home/">Ahmed E. Hassan</a>. Before that, I received my MSc from Queen's University (under the same supervisor), and BSc in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>. During my PhD, I worked as an embedded researcher in the Performance Engineering department at <a href="http://ca.blackberry.com/">BlackBerry</a> from January 2013 to December 2016.

<!--
My research focus is on improving the quality of large-scale software systems by leveraging techniques from program analysis and data mining.

My research aims to solve challenges such as:

- Can we quickly help developers debug production system by utilizing rich software data? 
- How to improve software quality assurances in DevOps environment?
- Can we provide useful suggestions to developers by mining software development history?

My research focuses on improving the quality of large-scale software systems. I work on bug detection, software performance analysis, cloud-based systems, database-centric systems, software testing, and mining software repositories. <!--My research has received multiple prestigious awards and I am ranked as one of the most active software engineering researchers around the world. -->The research tools developed by myself and my students were integrated into industrial practice for ensuring the quality of large-scale enterprise systems.</p>

<p>In particular, my research aims to solve challenges such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can we quickly help developers debug production systems by utilizing rich software data?</li>
<li>Can we provide suggestions on how to optimize the software system by analyzing user usage data?</li>
<li>How to improve software quality assurances in DevOps environments by analyzing test results from continuous integration?</li>
<li>Can we provide useful suggestions to developers by mining software development history?</li>
</ul>

I spent four years working as an embedded researchers in the Performance Engineer at BlackBerry, where I developed tools for detecting database-related performance bugs using both static (<a href="papers/peter_icse2014.pdf">ICSE 2014</a>) and dynamic analysis (<a href="papers/peter_tse2016.pdf">TSE 2016</a>). The tools that I developed are integrated into industrial practice and our experience reports are published in the premier conference in the Software Engineering community (<a href="papers/peter_icse_seip2016.pdf">ICSE-SEIP 2016</a> and <a href="">ICSE-SEIP 2017</a>).

I also have research experiences and interests in many areas of Software Engineering and Data Mining, including, but not limited to, text analysis (<a href="papers/peter_msr2012.pdf">MSR 2012</a>, <a href="papers/peter_jss2016.pdf">JSS 2016</a>, and <a href="papers/peter_emse_survey2015.pdf">EMSE 2016</a>), mining software repositories (<a href="papers/peter_msr2014.pdf">MSR 2014</a> and <a href="papers/tarek_apm_msr2016.pdf">MSR 2016-1</a>), and empirical software engineering (<a href="papers/peter_orm_msr2016.pdf">MSR 2016-2</a>).

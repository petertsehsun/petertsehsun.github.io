      <description>Queen&#39;s University in September 2016. I was a member of the Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL) and I was supervised by an amazing supervisor Ahmed E. Hassan. Before that, I received my MSc from Queen&#39;s University (under the same supervisor), and BSc in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia. During my PhD, I worked as an embedded researcher in the Performance Engineering department at BlackBerry from January 2013 to December 2016.</description>

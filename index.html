    <!--
I received my PhD in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.queensu.ca">Queen's University</a> in September 2016. I was a member of the <a href="http://sail.cs.queensu.ca/">Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL)</a> and I was supervised by an amazing supervisor <a href="http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~ahmed/home/">Ahmed E. Hassan</a>. Before that, I received my MSc from Queen's University (under the same supervisor), and BSc in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>. During my PhD, I worked as an embedded researcher in the Performance Engineering department at <a href="http://ca.blackberry.com/">BlackBerry</a> from January 2013 to December 2016.
-->

<!--
My research focus is on improving the quality of large-scale software systems by leveraging techniques from program analysis and data mining.

My research aims to solve challenges such as:

- Can we quickly help developers debug production system by utilizing rich software data? 
- How to improve software quality assurances in DevOps environment?
- Can we provide useful suggestions to developers by mining software development history?
-->

<p><center><img src="img/SPEAR2_title.png" width="450" height="550"></img></center></p>

<p>I lead the <span style="color:red">S</span>oftware <span style="color:red">PE</span>rformance, <span style="color:red">A</span>nalysis, and <span style="color:red">R</span>eliability (SPEAR) lab at Concordia University. My research focuses on improving the quality of large-scale software systems. Specifically, I work on areas such as log analysis and AIOps, software performance analysis, software testing, and mining software repositories. My research group has extensive collaboration with companies such as ERA Environmental, Ericsson, Microsoft, and BlackBerry.</p>

<p>The research tools developed by myself and my students were integrated into industrial practice for ensuring the quality of large-scale enterprise systems. My research has received multiple prestigious awards and I am ranked as one of the most active software engineering researchers around the world by an <a href="https://bit.ly/3n6ibWm">independent study</a> published in JSS. Several graduated PhD/PostDoc from the SPEAR lab are now tenure-track assistant professors around the world (e.g., <a href="https://ginolzh.github.io/">York University</a>, <a href="https://anrchen.github.io/"> University of Alberta</a>, <a href="https://djaekim.github.io/djae.io/">DePaul University</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shouvick/shouvick-mondal">IIT Gandhinagar</a>).</p>

<p>In particular, my research aims to solve challenges such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can we leverage Large-Language Models (LLM) to assist developers with development, debugging, and maintenance?</li>
<li>Can we quickly help developers debug production systems by utilizing rich software data?</li>
<li>Can we provide suggestions on how to optimize the software system by analyzing user usage data?</li>
<li>How to improve software quality assurances in DevOps environments by analyzing test results from continuous integration?</li>
<li>Can we provide useful suggestions to developers by mining software development history?</li>
</ul>

<!--
I spent four years working as an embedded researchers in the Performance Engineer at BlackBerry, where I developed tools for detecting database-related performance bugs using both static (<a href="papers/peter_icse2014.pdf">ICSE 2014</a>) and dynamic analysis (<a href="papers/peter_tse2016.pdf">TSE 2016</a>). The tools that I developed are integrated into industrial practice and our experience reports are published in the premier conference in the Software Engineering community (<a href="papers/peter_icse_seip2016.pdf">ICSE-SEIP 2016</a> and <a href="">ICSE-SEIP 2017</a>).

I also have research experiences and interests in many areas of Software Engineering and Data Mining, including, but not limited to, text analysis (<a href="papers/peter_msr2012.pdf">MSR 2012</a>, <a href="papers/peter_jss2016.pdf">JSS 2016</a>, and <a href="papers/peter_emse_survey2015.pdf">EMSE 2016</a>), mining software repositories (<a href="papers/peter_msr2014.pdf">MSR 2014</a> and <a href="papers/tarek_apm_msr2016.pdf">MSR 2016-1</a>), and empirical software engineering (<a href="papers/peter_orm_msr2016.pdf">MSR 2016-2</a>).
